## Wheat Disease Classification

Wheat disease classification is a critical task in agriculture, aimed at identifying and mitigating crop 
diseases to ensure high yield and food security. This study employs advanced machine learning 
techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately classify various wheat 
diseases from leaf images. By leveraging a large dataset of annotated wheat leaf images, the model 
can learn distinguishing features of common diseases such as yellow rust, brown rust and healthy. The 
CNN architecture is designed to handle the variability in disease manifestation, ensuring robust 
performance under diverse field conditions. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy, 
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This automated classification system offers a 
scalable solution for real-time disease monitoring, aiding farmers in timely and precise disease 
management. The integration of this technology into existing agricultural practices can significantly 
reduce crop losses and promote sustainable farming.
